# Mappie Beta Walkthrough Script

## Introduction

[Casual desk setup shot]

Hey beta testers! James here. Let me show you around Mappie, starting with the most important part - creating your first epic.

## Creating Your First Epic

[Screen share showing empty state with ghost icon]

So this is your starting point. Pretty clean, right? You've got two ways to kick things off:

### Option 1: Create New (The Classic Way)

[Hover over "Create New" button]

This is your blank canvas approach. Click this if you:
- Already have a clear idea in mind
- Want to structure things your way
- Prefer to start from scratch

### Option 2: Ideate with AI (The Fun Way)

[Hover over "Ideate with AI" button]

This is where the magic happens. Just tell the AI what's on your mind, like:
- "I need a better way to manage my plant watering schedule"
- "Build a recipe app for college students"
- Or even "Help me organize my cat's Instagram career"
(Yes, someone actually tried that one, and the AI ran with it!)

[Quick sidebar about navigation]

You'll notice on the left:
- Your epics list (empty for now, but not for long!)
- Settings for customizing your experience
- And yes, that "Feature Requests" button - we actually read those!

Let's create something together...

## AI Ideation

[Screen showing AI Ideation modal]

So let's click that "Ideate with AI" button to plan our Notion integration. When this popup appears, you'll see three prompts that help focus our idea:

- üéØ **What do you want to build?**
  "A new Notion feature that adds AI-powered voice journaling. Users can speak their thoughts while an AI assistant structures the notes and asks clarifying questions to ensure everything is documented correctly in their Notion workspace"

- üë• **Who is it for?**
  "For existing Notion users who prefer voice input over typing, especially those who journal regularly but find manual formatting and organization time-consuming"

- üé® **Why are you building it?**
  "To enhance Notion's note-taking capabilities with a more natural, conversational approach. This will help users maintain better documentation while leveraging Notion's existing organization features"

Quick tip: Choose your documentation language here - super helpful when working with international teams or if Notion is being used in different markets!

[Click Generate button]

Now let's see how our AI turns this Notion feature idea into a structured epic...

## Generated Epic Structure

[Screen transitions to generated epic]

And just like that, Mappie has created a complete epic structure for our Notion voice journaling feature! Let's look at what we've got:

[Point to each section as we discuss]

At the top, we've got our Epic Summary - it's beautifully captured everything:
- Target Audience: Notion users who prefer voice over typing
- Problem Statement: Making journal organization less time-consuming
- Key Benefits: Enhanced note-taking with AI-powered conversation
- Competitive Edge: What makes this stand out in Notion

[Hover over the menu icon on the left]

See this menu icon? Hover over it and... tada! You get this super organized table of contents:
- Epic Template üéØ and Summary üåü - Your high-level overview
- Problem üí≠ - The pain points we're solving
- Objectives (SMART) üéØ - Our measurable goals
- Constraints üöß - Our realistic boundaries
- Personas üë• - Who we're building for
- User Scenarios üì± - How it'll be used
- Features In ‚úÖ and Out ‚ùå - Clear scope definition
- Technical Considerations ‚öôÔ∏è - The nuts and bolts
- Success Metrics üìä - How we'll measure impact

[Scroll through document]

Everything you see is editable - just click and start typing. Don't like how we described the personas? Change it! Want to add more success metrics? Go for it!

[Show right sidebar]

And check out your AI assistant over here - it's like having a product manager in your pocket. Need to expand any section? Just ask!

[Point to top buttons]

Quick actions up here let you:
- "Use Epic Template" for different formats
- "Generate FR" to create functional requirements
- Plus all your basic formatting tools

Want to see how we can customize this further?

## AI Context Awareness

[Show AI assistant in action]

Here's something really cool: the AI chat is context-aware. See how I asked it to rewrite the problem statement? It knows exactly what we're working on and provides tailored suggestions.

[Point to AI suggestions]

You can do this for any part of the epic structure. Whether it's refining objectives, tweaking personas, or adjusting success metrics, the AI is ready to help.

But don't worry, we'll dive deeper into customizing each section in other videos. For now, just know that Mappie's AI is like having a smart co-pilot for your documentation journey.

## Functional Requirements

[Screen showing functional requirements section]

Once you've got enough information about your epic, it's time to dive into functional requirements. This step helps flesh out your epic even more, making it easier to determine the features and user stories later on.

[Point to "Generate Initial Functional Requirements" button]

Now, we know not all companies or product delivery teams document functional requirements, but here, it's an optional helper. If you choose to use it, just click "Generate Initial Functional Requirements."

[Show generated requirements]

Mappie will create multiple requirements with detailed sub-requirements. You'll also have the option to generate additional functional requirements on top of these.

[Highlight the benefits]

This process ensures you have a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be built, helping streamline development and align your team.

[Wrap up]

Whether you use this feature or not, it's all about making your documentation journey smoother and more efficient. Ready to see how this ties into features and user stories?

## Features

[Screen showing features section]

Now that we've got our functional requirements, let's move on to features. This is where we outline the main functionalities of our epic.

[Point to "Generate Initial Features" button]

With a click of "Generate Initial Features," Mappie will create a list of features based on the epic details. This helps ensure that all key aspects are covered.

[Show feature generation]

You can also add features manually if you have specific ideas in mind. This flexibility lets you tailor the feature set to your project's needs.

[Highlight user stories section]

Once your features are set, you can generate user stories. These stories help define how users will interact with each feature, making it easier to plan development and testing.

[Wrap up]

This process streamlines the transition from ideas to actionable plans, ensuring nothing gets overlooked. Ready to see how user stories bring everything together?

## User Stories

[Screen showing user stories section]

Now that we've outlined our features, it's time to bring them to life with user stories. These stories define how users will interact with each feature.

[Point to "Generate Initial User Stories" button]

Click "Generate Initial User Stories," and watch as Mappie crafts detailed user stories for each feature. This helps ensure that every aspect of user interaction is covered.

[Show generation progress]

You'll see the progress as the AI works its magic, turning features into actionable stories.

[Display generated user story]

Here's an example for the Smart Content Organizer feature:
- **User Story**: As a journal user, I want my voice recordings to be automatically structured into logical sections and headings, so that I can have well-organized journal entries without manual formatting.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Scenarios that detail how the feature should function.

[Highlight additional stories]

Mappie generates multiple stories, each with specific scenarios and acceptance criteria, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

[Wrap up]

This process bridges the gap between features and development, making it easier to plan and execute. Ready to see how this all comes together in your project?
